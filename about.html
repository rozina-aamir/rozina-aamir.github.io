    <h1>a little bit about me</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
      <pre>
        i'm a multidisciplinary artist, illustrator, and designer with an
        interest in digital art along with looking at how technology affects
        art and vice versa.

        i'm also a self-taught frontend web developer, currently learning and
        focusing on building sites with html and css.

        pairing both my practice as a multidisciplinary artist along with my
        interest in technology, i'm a self-taught creative coder and i create
        small self-built programs with processing (which is a java-based 
        programming language aimed at artists) that are more expressive
        rather than functional, tying in with my interests on how technology
        can be used as an art form rather than just a tool.
