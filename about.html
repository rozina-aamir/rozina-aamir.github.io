      hi, i'm rozina, and i'm a digital artist with a design based practice that focuses on how technology affects art and vice versa. my work looks at the creative use of technology, as well as viewig it as an art form rather than just a tool to do everyday things. i also experiment with typography in different ways, and this goes hand in hand with using technology as a creative medium by creating prototypes of self-built software that will allow the user to play around with typography in different ways, to build upon both my graphic design and technological backgrounds, acting as a middle ground to bring those subject areas together to create new possibilities and innovate in ways that didn't exist before. my practice looks at how art can be interesting to a contemporary 21st century audience, as well as showing others that using technology can lead to new and exciting discoveries.
